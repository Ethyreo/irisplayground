# Produtionizing ML models with single page web apps

## Technologies used 
<br>

>Docker - For containerizing all necessary requirements for the app

>GitHub Docker Integration - For automatic image build with repository commit

> Python Flask - For rendering a single page app with the models loaded on the background 

> Azure Functions - To demonstrate how a docker image can be used in a serverless consumption model

> HTML - For the single web app

## Disclaimer 

This repository is not a Machine Learning Tutorial . But a tutorial to demonstrate how quickly one can productionize Machine Learing Models with minimal effort.
